# code_quiz

## Description

I created a timed three question quiz, that saved your score at the end. I built this project to work on my skills using A.P.I.'s. I now have a much better understanding on how to make and use Event Listeners. I also learned how to set up a timer. 

## Installation

I needed to set up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Set up created variables that I would use throughout the code. Created questions and answers in an array. Made functioning buttons using EventListener. Used JSON and Local Storage to set up saving the score and initials. Used SetInterval to set up the timer.
